# Updating your app

We have live updates together with EXPO OTA \(Over The Air \) updates.

So. you will need to submit a new build only if you have a new App name.  App Icon or App Splash. 

Everything else is manageable from our panel.

To submit a new version - change app name, icon or splash. Go in the Submit screen and submit the app for compiling once again..
